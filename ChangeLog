2004-11-30  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ijbridge.conf.sample: NEW sample config file for ijbridge.

	* TAG:     ====== tagged xmppd-1-0-0  =====

	* test-s2s.tcl: Test application code.
	* s2s.tcl: Working version. This correctly validates and xmits and
	recieves. Added a handler option that is called for all Jabber
	stanzas. Moved application code into separate file so s2s can be a
	package. Fixed recovery after a channel goes down.

2004-11-24  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* s2s.tcl: Finally persuaded both sides to validate. Jabberd is
	now prepared to talk to us (at least when _we_ initiate the
	connection).

2004-11-24  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* s2s.tcl: Redesigned to separate channels and sessions living on
	top of channels. This permits multiple routes over a single socket
	(which jabberd2 is doing). Close.

2004-11-20  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* s2s.tcl: Still in progress. This version nicely keeps each
	stream (in/out) separated but manages to use the same callbacks
	quite simple. We are successully dealing with the outbound
	connections (jabberd2 is happy) but we are not managing to handle
	the inbound ones properly. This is because both all.tclers.tk and
	tach.tclers.tk are coming in on the same channel. So we have to be
	able to hook up multiple sessions per channel.

2004-11-19  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* s2s.tcl: Still not complete. Reconfigured big time.

2004-11-18  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* s2s.tcl: NEW file: Jabber server to server daemon.
